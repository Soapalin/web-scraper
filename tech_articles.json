It has evaluated a potential acquisition target for the move. The scarcity of graphics processing units is making it difficult for OpenAI to solve its chip shortage issues. It may take several years for OpenAI to develop its own chip if it decides to go ahead with the plan. Success in developing a custom chip is not guaranteed - many companies, including Meta, have been building their own processors for years with limited results.","date":"2023-10-06","category":"big","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":235759,"url":"https://news.mit.edu/2023/desalination-system-could-produce-freshwater-cheaper-0927?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"Desalination system could produce freshwater that is cheaper than tap water (4 minute read)","tldr":"A team of engineers from MIT and China have designed a solar desalination system that passively turns seawater into drinking water. It circulates water in swirling eddies, which when combined with the sun's heat drives water to evaporate and leave salt behind. The resulting water vapor can be condensed and collected while the leftover salt circulates out of the device rather than accumulating and clogging the system. A small suitcase-sized system could produce up to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last several years.","date":"2023-10-06","category":"future","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":235760,"url":"https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/new-3d-printing-approach-offers-hope-for-brain-injury-repair?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"New 3D printing approach offers hope for brain injury repair (4 minute read)","tldr":"Scientists from the University of Oxford have created brain tissue using human stem cells through 3D printing. They were able to replicate the structure of the brain's cerebral cortex using the technique. The technology will provide researchers with new ways to explore the workings of the brain. It also offers hopes to individuals who have brain injuries as there is evidence that the printed tissue can integrate with live brains.","date":"2023-10-06","category":"future","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":235761,"url":"https://www.vantage.sh/blog/cloud-costs-every-programmer-should-know?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"Cloud Costs Every Programmer Should Know (10 minute read)","tldr":"This article contains a list of cloud costs every programmer should know with a detailed breakdown of the costs.

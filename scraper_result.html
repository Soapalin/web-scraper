        <p>
            Newly unsealed court testimonies reveal that Apple held talks with Microsoft and DuckDuckGo to use their
            search engines across Apple devices. The company even considered buying Bing. An internal email suggests
            that the talks were a negotiating tactic to extract more money from Google. Microsoft was aware that it was
            being used for leverage.

                Exclusive-ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips (3 minute read)

        </h3>
        <p>
            OpenAI is exploring making its own artificial intelligence chips. It has evaluated a potential acquisition
            target for the move. The scarcity of graphics processing units is making it difficult for OpenAI to solve
            its chip shortage issues. It may take several years for OpenAI to develop its own chip if it decides to go
            ahead with the plan. Success in developing a custom chip is not guaranteed - many companies, including Meta,
            have been building their own processors for years with limited results.

        </h3>
        <p>
            A team of engineers from MIT and China have designed a solar desalination system that passively turns
            seawater into drinking water. It circulates water in swirling eddies, which when combined with the sun's
            heat drives water to evaporate and leave salt behind. The resulting water vapor can be condensed and
            collected while the leftover salt circulates out of the device rather than accumulating and clogging the
            system. A small suitcase-sized system could produce up to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last
            several years.

            Scientists from the University of Oxford have created brain tissue using human stem cells through 3D
            printing. They were able to replicate the structure of the brain's cerebral cortex using the technique. The
            technology will provide researchers with new ways to explore the workings of the brain. It also offers hopes
            to individuals who have brain injuries as there is evidence that the printed tissue can integrate with live
            brains.

        <p>
            Google has a process called “readability” that allows it to maintain certain coding standards and best
            practices in its monolithic codebase. It has published its style guides online and has described the
            readability process in its book “Software Engineering at Google”. Readability helps Google increase
            knowledge sharing, maintain its codebase's health, enforce best practices, and sustain a culture of
            mentorship. However, readability results in slower code velocity. The article goes through some examples of
            clean TypeScript code using Google’s style guide.

            GitHub is a remote-first company, so its communication approach is rooted in asynchronous communication. The
            team uses GitHub not just for code hosting, but also for planning, discussing, and documenting work. To
            manage communication effectively, they created the "How we communicate" guidance, with rules such as
            preferring asynchronous communication and embracing collaboration. GitHub also uses AI to reduce
            notification fatigue and summarize discussion posts, making it easy for people to catch up on conversations
            they missed quickly.

            Traditional cloud computing often confines users to vendor-specific platforms. Sky Computing reduces this
            dependency – it’s a technical abstraction layer on top of cloud providers that allow cloud apps to operate
            freely across multiple cloud providers. This approach offers benefits such as cost optimization, redundancy,
            risk mitigation, and performance enhancement. It allows companies to achieve greater flexibility,
            scalability, and avoid vendor lock-in, while cloud providers can tap into new revenue opportunities and
            expand their market share.

            Mechanistic interpretability is the process of understanding neural networks by breaking them down into more
            interpretable sub-pieces. Unfortunately, neurons tend to not be interpretable by themselves. There are a
            number of deep reasons like superposition that lead to this challenge. This work by Anthropic uses a sparse
            autoencoder to generate interpretable representations from a one-layer Transformer. It’s a big step forward
            in our understanding of these models.

            will outlast the AI rush. The overarching theme is that SEO is not dead. To continue earning search traffic,
            marketers should optimize an SEO system with efficient processes and focus on their target customers above

        <p>
            zkUniswap is a novel proof-of-concept demonstrating a version of UniswapV3 with an off-chain computation of
            a swap. Execution involves using a zero-knowledge proof-based system to validate transactions, potentially
            reducing on-chain computation costs. zkUniswap minimizes 'front running' by utilizing a pool locking system
            to prevent state changes during swap transactions. Despite the still-high computation cost, parallelization
            of swaps and alternative implementations of request methods could make zkAMMs increasingly efficient.

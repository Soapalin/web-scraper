    More than 200 scientists have signed a letter calling for responsible research into ways to trap carbon dioxide in oceans. The group wants to take urgent action on the climate crisis without triggering any new problems by using oceans to help the fight. There are a lot of unknowns about the side effects of adding more carbon dioxide into the sea. The letter calls for controlled field trials to evaluate carbon removal strategies, third-party reviews of trial results, and safeguards to prevent unintended or adverse consequences.

    Software engineers can become agnostic about business outcomes as they optimize for versatility and feature shipping efficiency. This can become an issue if they decide to become freelancers as becoming a freelancer forces them into a business owner position. Becoming a professional business owner means becoming an expert in delivering outcomes that add value. Working by the hour makes this goal harder to achieve and it also creates a worse experience for both the freelancer and their clients.

   <p>
    Zero shot models are AI models that have robust performance on a broad range of distributions. However, if you tune them on your narrow task, they tend to lose that ability while simultaneously getting much better at what they're trained for. This is good but could be improved. This paper presents a method to tune such models, like CLIP to maintain their generalizability while improving specific performance.

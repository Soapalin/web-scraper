    Embryonic stem cells are difficult to obtain and they can be rejected following transplants if they don't match the recipient's DNA. Australian researchers have developed a technique to reprogram adult cells to be more like embryonic stem cells. These cells can then be reprogrammed to become any kind of cell. The technique potentially unlocks an endless supply of stem cells for research or treatment.

    This is a guide on how to create flexible and type-safe code environments using Typescript features like generics and advanced function types. Advanced function types help developers write robust and flexible code that adheres to static typing and OOP principles, through features like function overloading and optional, default, and rest parameters. Generics allow developers to create components that engage with various data types while preserving type information, ensuring both type safety and code reusability. The guide provides explanations and code examples of these concepts and also gives some best practices and pitfalls to avoid.

   <p>
    Databases are notoriously hard to build and they have complex problems that are still being worked on today. Cloud-native databases are much more common as data has become more valuable and data sizes get larger. Building a cloud-native database adds another huge layer of complexity to the already hard problem set of databases. For example, it is expected that databases can scale up and down much more flexibly in the cloud, but this is very hard to do in practice.

    Canarytokens is a security company that helps customers detect intrusions by using Canarytokens: decoys that are placed on a customer's network or systems. It recently realized that some of its customers, due to an example in its documentation, were using the same custom domain for their Canarytokens. This made the Canarytokens more identifiable because attackers could simply look for domains that matched the custom domain. To address this, Canarytokens will now show multiple examples of custom domains to its customers. This will make it more likely that customers will choose a unique custom domain for their Canarytokens, which will make them more difficult for attackers to identify.

    Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has controlling stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink. These three companies have moved their respective industries so far forward that governments depend on them. For example, Tesla’s charging infrastructure plays a role in the US government’s push toward clean energy. NASA almost solely uses SpaceX rockets now. Starlink has played a role in the Russia-Ukraine war. This article delves into how Elon Musk is not just a key player in technology anymore, but inadvertently a geopolitical player by himself due to the level of influence he has through his companies. This has been further shown by Musk’s purchase of Twitter, through which he has a social media platform where a lot of online discourse and political information disseminates.

     AI startups: Sell work, not software (4 minute read)
    </a>
   </h3>
   <p>
    LLMs offer a paradigm shift for startups from selling software aimed at user productivity to selling the actual work product itself. Companies can capitalize on this by automating specialized tasks (like creating a demand package for law firms) rather than just improving productivity incrementally. This approach competes with outsourced solutions, potentially offering more consistency and value, while reallocating human capital to higher-value tasks.

    Binance is being investigated by the DOJ over potential US sanctions violations concerning Russia. Despite scaling back operations in Russia following the Ukraine invasion and implementing Western sanctions requirements, substantial ruble trading has continued on Binance's platform. The exchange is suspected of helping clients convert funds from sanctioned Russian banks into Binance balances and enabling trades involving blacklisted banks. This is just another of many accusations that US regulators have made and are investigating Binance over.

It points out that the app has a lack of bot protection, which could potentially allow for DDoS attacks and information sniping. The wallets on the platform are not very secure. They are generated by Friend.tech and you can export the keys if you would like to connect to your wallet outside of the app. However, this means that Friend.tech has your private keys, making them vulnerable to a platform hack.

   </h3>
   <p>
    Elusiv has launched private token swaps on Solana, marking its first steps into private DeFi. Unlike typical decentralized exchanges with complete transparency, Elusiv allows users to swap assets anonymously. The swaps use temporary keys to unlink a user's public key and transaction, enhancing security and privacy. Privacy-focused protocols have had trouble gaining traction and steering clear of legal issues, so the fact that this is on an already widely used chain like Solana could help bring privacy-focused users on board.

The stablecoin’s release will be a shift from an over-collateralized system to a reserve-backed approach. One of the methods it will use includes a dynamic leverage principal-protected positions setup where the reserves, based on volatile assets like ETH, will be delta-neutral hedged. Through these innovations, Liquity aims to tackle the stablecoin trilemma: the simultaneous search for price stability, capital efficiency, and decentralization.

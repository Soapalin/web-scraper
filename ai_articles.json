Unfortunately, neurons tend to not be interpretable by themselves. There are a number of deep reasons like superposition that lead to this challenge. This work by Anthropic uses a sparse autoencoder to generate interpretable representations from a one-layer Transformer. It‚Äôs a big step forward in our understanding of these models.","date":"2023-10-06","category":"aiengineering","newsletter":"ai"},{"id":235792,"url":"https://sumanthrh.com/post/distributed-and-efficient-finetuning/?utm_source=tldrai","title":"Deep dive: everything about distributed training and efficient fine-tuning (39 minute read)","tldr":"There are different challenges when training language models on multi-GPU and multi-node systems.

Advanced function types help developers write robust and flexible code that adheres to static typing and OOP principles, through features like function overloading and optional, default, and rest parameters. Generics allow developers to create components that engage with various data types while preserving type information, ensuring both type safety and code reusability. The guide provides explanations and code examples of these concepts and also gives some best practices and pitfalls to avoid.","date":"2023-08-23","category":"webdevarticles","newsletter":"webdev"},{"id":229091,"url":"https://davidgomes.com/the-broad-set-of-computer-science-problems-faced-at-cloud-database-companies/?utm_source=tldrwebdev","title":"The Broad Set of Computer Science Problems Faced at Cloud Database Companies (3 minute read)","tldr":"Databases are notoriously hard to build and they have complex problems that are still being worked on today. Cloud-native databases are much more common as data has become more valuable and data sizes get larger. Building a cloud-native database adds another huge layer of complexity to the already hard problem set of databases. For example, it is expected that databases can scale up and down much more flexibly in the cloud, but this is very hard to do in practice.","date":"2023-08-23","category":"webdevopinons","newsletter":"webdev"},{"id":229109,"url":"https://x.com/iximiuz/status/1692917272145219849?utm_source=tldrwebdev","title":"Understanding Kubernetes Through VMs (X Thread)","tldr":"This thread explains Kubernetes through a series of deployment evolutions, starting with VMs, to docked containers, then to Kubernetes pods.

It recently realized that some of its customers, due to an example in its documentation, were using the same custom domain for their Canarytokens. This made the Canarytokens more identifiable because attackers could simply look for domains that matched the custom domain. To address this, Canarytokens will now show multiple examples of custom domains to its customers. This will make it more likely that customers will choose a unique custom domain for their Canarytokens, which will make them more difficult for attackers to identify.","date":"2023-08-23","category":"webdevopinons","newsletter":"webdev"},{"id":229096,"url":"https://porkbun.com/land/dot-pro-domain-name-registration?coupon=DOTPROFREE2\u0026amp;utm_source=DevMedia\u0026amp;utm_medium=Newsletter\u0026amp;utm_campaign=DevMedia2023","title":"Get a FREE domain for your personal website or portfolio (Sponsor)","tldr":"Need a place to showcase your digital portfolio?

Starlink has played a role in the Russia-Ukraine war. This article delves into how Elon Musk is not just a key player in technology anymore, but inadvertently a geopolitical player by himself due to the level of influence he has through his companies.
